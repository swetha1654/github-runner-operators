# Terraform CC008 Migration

## Overview

Bring every Terraform module in a repository up to the **CC008 — Charm Terraform
Standards** specification, and wire the repository to the compliance, test and
release automation provided by
[canonical/operator-workflows](https://github.com/canonical/operator-workflows/tree/main/terraform-compliance).

## When To Use

- A repository ships one or more Terraform modules that predate CC008 (CC006-era
  layout, `versions.tf`, combined `endpoints` output, unpinned module sources).
- A new module must be authored so that it is CC008-compliant from the start.
- A CC008 compliance check fails in CI and the module needs to be corrected.

## Source Of Truth

[`assets/cc008.spec.md`](assets/cc008.spec.md) **is** the specification. Read the
sections relevant to the modules you are migrating *before* editing anything, and
resolve every question against it. This skill does not restate the spec; it only
reinforces the parts that are most often missed and describes the repository
plumbing the spec does not cover.

### Fetching The Companion Files

This skill ships two companion files next to `SKILL.md`: `assets/cc008.spec.md`
and `scripts/check_cc008.sh`. When the skill is installed as a directory — for
example synced to `.github/skills/terraform-cc008-migration/` — they are already
on disk and the relative paths above resolve.

When only `SKILL.md` was fetched (`copilot skill add <url>` materializes a single
file), download them first and use the downloaded copies wherever this document
refers to them:

```bash
CC008_BASE="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/copilot-collections/main/groups/platform-engineering/skills/terraform-cc008-migration"
mkdir -p /tmp/cc008
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/cc008/cc008.spec.md "$CC008_BASE/assets/cc008.spec.md"
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/cc008/check_cc008.sh "$CC008_BASE/scripts/check_cc008.sh"
chmod +x /tmp/cc008/check_cc008.sh
```

Delete `/tmp/cc008` once the migration is verified; it must never be committed.

### Secondary References

In order of authority when they disagree:

1. [platform-engineering-charm-template/terraform](https://github.com/canonical/platform-engineering-charm-template/tree/main/terraform)
   — the canonical, always-up-to-date reference module. Prefer copying its exact
   patterns.
2. [operator-workflows/terraform-compliance](https://github.com/canonical/operator-workflows/tree/main/terraform-compliance)
   — the checker that decides whether the migration passed.
3. Finished migrations:
   [gateway-api-integrator-operator#320](https://github.com/canonical/gateway-api-integrator-operator/pull/320/files),
   [mailserver-operators#48](https://github.com/canonical/mailserver-operators/pull/48/files).

## Module Discovery And Classification

Treat every directory containing a `main.tf` (or an existing `versions.tf` /
`terraform.tf`) as one module, whether the repository has a single `terraform/`
directory or several — per-charm `<charm>/terraform`, product modules under
`terraform/<product>` or `terraform-product/`. Enumerate them all before
starting:

```bash
find . -type f -name 'main.tf' -not -path '*/.terraform/*' -exec dirname {} \; | sort -u
```

**Then classify each module before applying any rule.** The categories have
*different* input and output contracts, and applying the wrong one is the most
common migration mistake:

| Category | What it deploys | Key outputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Charm module** | a single charm | `application`, plus `provides` / `requires` |
| **Product module** | a ready-to-use solution, incl. models and integrations | `models`, `metadata` |
| **Deployment** | one specific environment | n/a — versions state and `backend.tf` |

CC008 also defines *component modules* (several charms sharing one release
cycle). We have none yet, so this skill carries no rules for them — read the
"Component modules" section of the spec directly if you ever meet one.

The universal rules below apply to every category; then follow **only** the
section matching the category you classified.

## DO — Every Module

- **DO** ensure each module has `terraform.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`,
  `main.tf` and `README.md`. Rename a legacy `versions.tf` to `terraform.tf`,
  leaving the content unchanged except where the next rule requires otherwise.
- **DO** require, in `terraform.tf`, a Terraform `required_version` and a
  `juju/juju` provider version that admits `>= 1.0.0` (for example `~> 1.0`, or
  `> 1.0.0, < 2.0.0`).
- **DO** order `variable` blocks in `variables.tf` and `output` blocks in
  `outputs.tf` alphabetically by name.
- **DO** set `nullable = false` on every variable that must always resolve to a
  concrete value (`app_name`, `channel`, `model_uuid`, …) so callers cannot pass
  an explicit `null` and bypass the default. Leave variables that intentionally
  default to `null` (`base`, `constraints`, `revision`, …) nullable.
- **DO** give every output a `description`.
- **DO** add a `terraform/MAJOR_VERSION` file at the root of each independent
  module family, containing only the current major version number and no trailing
  newline (start at `1` for a first migration). In multi-module repositories,
  make additional modules' `MAJOR_VERSION` files a relative symlink to that root
  file **only** when those modules share the same release train (the
  mailserver-operators#48 pattern); otherwise give each independently tagged
  module family its own file.
- **DO** add a `tests/main.tftest.hcl` per module, using `mock_provider "juju"`
  and asserting the module's key outputs, when the module has no test yet.
- **DO** pin every Terraform module `source = "git::...//terraform..."` reference
  — in README examples and in product modules — to a `?ref=` tag
  or commit hash such as `?ref=tf-1.0.0`. Floating references such as branches
  are **not allowed**.

## DO — Charm Modules

- **DO** declare the mandatory variables: `app_name`, `channel`, `config`,
  `constraints`, `model_uuid` (no default) and `revision`. Add `units` unless the
  charm is a subordinate charm, which **must** omit it. Determine this
  deterministically — never guess from the charm's name or description: read
  the module's own `charmcraft.yaml` (walk up from the `terraform/` directory
  to the charm root if it lives elsewhere, e.g. `../charmcraft.yaml` or
  `../../charmcraft.yaml`) and check its top-level `subordinate:` key.
  `subordinate: true` means omit `units`; anything else (including the key
  being absent, which defaults to `false`) means `units` is mandatory. The
  compliance checker treats `units` as optional either way, so it will not
  catch a wrong call — getting the classification right is this skill's
  responsibility, not the checker's.
- **DO** add the optional CC008 variables when they are relevant to the charm:
  `base`, `expose`, `resources`, `machines`, `endpoint_bindings`,
  `storage_directives`, `offered_endpoints`.
- **DO** output `application` as the `juju_application` resource object itself —
  `value = juju_application.<name>` — not its `.name`.
- **DO** output `provides` and `requires` as `map(object({...}))`, one key per
  relation endpoint the charm actually declares, each entry carrying at least
  `kind = "endpoint"`, `name = juju_application.<name>.name` and
  `endpoint = "<relation-endpoint-name>"`. Add `controller = null` when the
  relation supports cross-model integration. They are mandatory as soon as the
  charm declares endpoints of that kind; use `value = {}` only when it declares
  none.
- **DO** replace any deprecated combined `endpoint` / `endpoints` output with the
  `provides` / `requires` split.

## DO — Product Modules

A product module deploys a ready-to-use solution and owns the `juju_model`,
secret and integration resources tying its charms together. It does **not**
declare `requires`: everything the product needs from the outside is supplied
through input variables, and everything it offers to the outside is exposed
through `offers`.

- **DO** express every external requirement — a database, TLS, an existing
  ingress, a COS stack — as an input variable carrying the endpoint or offer to
  integrate with, rather than as a `requires` output for a caller to wire up.
- **DO** take `proxy` and `logging-config` as mandatory inputs whenever the
  module creates or manages its own `juju_model` resources, plus `risk` to
  control the channel risk of the bundled components.
- **DO** expose the charm revision **and** the OCI resources of every bundled
  charm as input variables, so deployments are reproducible and air-gap capable.
- **DO** provide a default implementation for mandatory external integrations
  (database, TLS) behind `count = 0`, so it is dropped when the user supplies
  their own endpoint or offer through the corresponding variable.
- **DO** output `models`, mapping each model key to its `model_uuid` and the
  components deployed in it, and `metadata` carrying at least `version`,
  `deployed_at` and `updated_at`. Both are mandatory.
- **DO** output `offers` and, where the solution issues them, `credentials`.

## DO — Deployments

- **DO** add `backend.tf` with the backend configuration, and version every file
  describing the deployment **including** the state.
- **DO** pin every referenced charm and product module to a tag or commit hash.

## DO — CI Workflows

Use operator-workflows' reusable workflows instead of hand-written scripts.

- **DO** add or update `.github/workflows/terraform_modules_release.yaml` calling
  `canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/terraform_modules_release.yaml`,
  triggered on push to `main` and on pull requests touching `terraform/**` (plus
  any other module paths), with `permissions: contents: write`.
- **DO** add `.github/workflows/terraform_modules_compliance.yaml` calling
  `canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/terraform_modules_compliance.yaml`,
  triggered on pull requests touching `**/terraform/**`, with a
  `terraform-directories` input listing every discovered module directory.
- **DO** update `.github/workflows/test_terraform_modules.yaml` to call
  `canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/terraform_modules_test.yaml`
  with `terraform-directories` listing every discovered module directory, and
  trigger it on pull requests touching `**/terraform/**`.
- **DO** add `.github/workflows/generate_terraform_docs.yaml` calling
  `canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/generate_terraform_docs.yaml`.
  Trigger it on pushes to `main` that touch `**/terraform/**` or this workflow
  file, with these caller permissions so it can create the documentation pull
  request:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
  ```
- **DO** pass every discovered module directory as a comma-separated
  `terraform-directory` input to the docs workflow. Do not rely on its default
  of `terraform` when modules live elsewhere. Ensure each module's
  `README.md` contains `<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS -->` and `<!-- END_TF_DOCS -->`
  markers for the generated content.
- **DO** leave the docs workflow's `auto-merge` input unset to retain its
  default of `true`. It generates the README changes and opens or updates a
  `terraform-docs` pull request after the push to `main`.
- **DO** add each of these three workflow files to *its own* `paths` filter, on
  every trigger it declares:

  ```yaml
  on:
    pull_request:
      paths:
        - '**/terraform/**'
        - '.github/workflows/terraform_modules_compliance.yaml'
  ```

  Without this, bumping the pinned reusable-workflow SHA does not run the new
  checks on the pull request that bumps it, so a breaking change in
  operator-workflows lands unverified.
- **DO** pin every new — and every pre-existing unpinned — reusable-workflow call
  to a commit SHA. Reuse the SHA already used elsewhere in the repository for
  `canonical/operator-workflows` if one exists; otherwise resolve the latest
  `main` commit yourself and pin to it with a `# main` comment, as
  platform-engineering-charm-template does:

  ```bash
  git ls-remote https://github.com/canonical/operator-workflows.git main
  ```

  Apply this SHA-pinning requirement to the Terraform docs workflow as well.

## DO — Repository Housekeeping

- **DO** add `**/.terraform/` and `**/.terraform.lock.hcl` to the top-level
  `.gitignore` if they are not already ignored.
- **DO** add `**/MAJOR_VERSION` to the `header.ignore` list in `.licenserc.yaml`
  so the version markers are exempt from license headers.
- **DO** add a changelog entry — in `docs/changelog.md`, or a new file under
  `docs/release-notes/artifacts/` if the repository uses that convention —
  describing the CC008 migration and any breaking default change (for example
  `expose` now defaulting to `{}` instead of `null`).

## DON'T

- **DON'T** change any module's deployment behaviour — resource arguments,
  variable defaults — beyond what CC008 requires. Preserve existing defaults
  unless the spec mandates a different one.
- **DON'T** apply the charm-module contract to a product module — no
  `app_name`/`channel`/`revision` variables, no `application` output, and no
  `provides` / `requires`.
- **DON'T** touch charm source code, `charmcraft.yaml`, or workflows unrelated to
  the Terraform modules.
- **DON'T** hand-roll a tagging or release workflow; call the canonical reusable
  workflow instead.
- **DON'T** leave `@main` or any floating branch or tag in a reusable-workflow
  call in the final diff, not even as a placeholder.
- **DON'T** commit the scratch directory used by the compliance checker, or any
  `.terraform/` artefact produced while validating.
- **DON'T** declare the migration finished on inspection alone — the compliance
  checker is the arbiter.

## Validate Before Declaring Done

Do not guess at compliance. Run the checker against every discovered module and
iterate until it passes clean:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/check_cc008.sh
```

`<skill-dir>` is wherever this skill is installed — typically
`.github/skills/terraform-cc008-migration/`. If you downloaded the companion
files instead, run `/tmp/cc008/check_cc008.sh`.

Called with no arguments the script discovers every module directory itself; pass
explicit directories to narrow the run:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/check_cc008.sh terraform charms/foo/terraform
```

It downloads the checker from operator-workflows into a temporary directory and
removes it afterwards, so nothing is left behind to commit.

Then run the repository's Terraform quality gates:

```bash
tflint --init && tflint --recursive
terraform fmt -recursive -check
terraform -chdir=<module-dir> init -backend=false && terraform -chdir=<module-dir> test
```

## Quality Bar

- The compliance checker passes for every discovered module directory.
- Every module was classified before editing, and follows the contract of its own
  category only.
- `tflint --recursive` and `terraform fmt -recursive -check` are clean.
- `terraform test` passes for every module.
- Every reusable-workflow call is pinned to a commit SHA, and every terraform
  workflow lists its own file in its `paths` filter.
- The Terraform docs workflow passes all discovered module directories,
  targets README files with the Terraform docs markers, and retains the default
  auto-merge behavior.
- The diff contains no scratch directory, no `.terraform/` artefact and no
  behavioural change beyond what CC008 requires.
